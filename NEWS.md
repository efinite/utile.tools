# utile.tools 0.2.4
* `calc_duration()`: Now supports the return of a `lubridate::duration()` object when the units parameter is left unspecified.

# utile.tools 0.2.3
* Improved NA value handling of `calc_duration()`.
* `paste_freq()`:
  - Added support for tallying factors.
  - Removed default rounding of numerators <1 to 0.
  - Calculated percentages may now return as infinity.
* `paste_` functions: Fixed parameter naming [BREAKING CHANGE]
* Consolidated `test_` functions into `test_hypothesis()` which has S3 methods for numeric, factor, and logical data. Numeric methods now support >2 strata. [BREAKING CHANGE]
  
# utile.tools 0.2.2
* Added `calc_chunks()` & `chunk_data_()`. Tools for breaking tibbles, data frames, and vectors into smaller, usable chunks of data.
* `tabulate_model()`: Formatted tables now combine the point estimate and confidence interval into a single column to be more consistent with the output of `utile.tables::` functions.
* `paste_freq()`: Non-numeric data is now tallied and documentation has been updated.
* `paste_mean()`/`paste_median()`/`paste_efs()`: Added checks for numeric data.

# utile.tools 0.2.1
* `calc_duration()`: Added support for multiple calculations against a single timepoint.

# utile.tools 0.2.0
* `tabulate_model()`: Rethought the purpose of this function.
  - Added `format=` option to return a human-readable, ready-to-export table.
  - Added `tabulate_model.glm()` which only supports the 'binomial' family of glm functions for now.
  - Added `tabulate_model.lm()` for linear regression model support.
  - Removed `tabulate_model.survfit()` as other packages (i.e. 'broom') already provide this functionality.
  - Refactored function design to make adding new methods easier.
* `tabulate_logit()`: Removed now that support has been added to `tabulate_model()`.
* `tabulate_at_risk()`: Now returns the strata column as factor instead of character type.
* `paste_freq()`: Switched from an S3 object to a regular function.
  - Fixed NA handling.
  - Added support for vectorized data (i.e. `dplyr::mutate()`).
  - Removed support for logical data. This seemed to be an edge case and was interfering with NA handling. May reconsider in future.
* `paste_median()`/`paste_mean()`: Fixed logic for returning '<1' if a statistic rounds to 0 and `less.than.one=TRUE`.
* `calc_duration()`:
  - Fixed NA handling.
  - Added hard stops for data types and vectors lengths.
  - Improved handling of vectorized data (i.e. `dplyr::mutate()`).
  - Added logic to ignore timestamps if mixed data types given (i.e. start = POSIXt, end = Date).
  - Removed rounding of negative numbers to 0.

# utile.tools 0.1.2
* First public release
